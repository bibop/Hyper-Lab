  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"AI_HyperLab\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"AI_HyperLab\":\n```\n\"Hyper-Lab\" is an innovative full-stack web application designed\
    \ for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture. It combines a modern graphical user interface with advanced\
    \ functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized Autogen Agents.\nEnhanced Key Features and Functionalities:\n\
    * Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically created for each project based on\
    \ user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a 'boss' and a 'critic'.\n* AI-Generated Agent Images: On user\
    \ request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting their functions and roles within the\
    \ project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization to the user experience.\n* RAG\
    \ Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling them to retain memory and\
    \ learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.\n* Persistent and Concurrent Interactions: The platform\
    \ ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.\n* Graphical\
    \ User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent's name, specialization,\
    \ and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.\n* User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various access levels\
    \ for enhanced security, along with features supporting real-time collaboration on AI projects.\n* Strict Adherence to\
    \ Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI services or frameworks.\n\
    * Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages, catering to\
    \ a global audience.\n* Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet to be established,\
    \ the application is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be provided in English.\n\
    References and Resources for Autogen:\n* Autogen Architecture Overview: Microsoft Autogen Blog\n* Agent AutoBuild Example:\
    \ Microsoft Autogen Blog - Agent AutoBuild\n* Detailed Articles on Autogen: Available at Microsoft Autogen Blog.\n\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- MongoDB\n- Mongoose\n\
    - jsonwebtoken\n- Passport.js\n- bcryptjs\n- Socket.io\n- React\n- Redux\n- axios\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- cron\n\
    - i18next\n- TensorFlow.js\n- sharp\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the\
    \ list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies including\
    \ Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.\n\n2. Set up the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user data storage.\n\
    \n3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes for registration,\
    \ login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.\n\n4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality with up to\
    \ eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas and controllers.\n\n5. Integrate TensorFlow.js for Retrievable\
    \ and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory and learn over time.\n\n6. Develop the GUI\
    \ for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the ability to upload\
    \ or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.\n\n7. Implement real-time collaboration features with Socket.io,\
    \ allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different user sessions.\n\n8. Add multilingual support and a mobile-responsive\
    \ design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters to a global audience.\n\n9. Finalize the application\
    \ by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user manual in English.\n\n\

    \ is a deprecated option: useNewUrlParser has no effect since Node.js Driver version 4.0.0 and will be removed in the\
    \ next major version\n(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)\n(node:65921) [MONGODB DRIVER]\
    \ Warning: useUnifiedTopology is a deprecated option: useUnifiedTopology has no effect since Node.js Driver version 4.0.0\
    \ and will be removed in the next major version\nServer is running on port 3000\nMongoDB Connected...\nMongoDB Connected\n\
    \n```\n\nCan you debug this issue or implement changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new\
    \ code that needs to be written or modified to implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the\
    \ environment is set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation\
    \ of new dependencies, if there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go\
    \ to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever\
    \ a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any\
    \ automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related\
    \ - only if some dependencies need to be installed."
- role: assistant
  content: "The warning messages received from your colleague indicate that certain options passed to the `mongoose.connect`\
    \ function are deprecated and should no longer be used. Since we are instructed not to modify existing files more than\
    \ necessary, we will only remove the deprecated options from the connection string in the `config/database.js` file:\n\
    \n**config/database.js** (modified part only)\n```javascript\nconst connectDB = async () => {\n  try {\n    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);\n\
    \    console.log('MongoDB Connected...');\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err.message);\n    process.exit(1);\n\
    \  }\n};\n```\n\nThe above changes should resolve the warnings related to the MongoDB driver deprecation. Since the task\
    \ also involves preparing for authentication and user data storage, we need to ensure the User schema and model are set\
    \ up correctly.\n\nBased on the provided files, the User schema in `models/User.js` looks well-defined and includes the\
    \ necessary fields for user authentication: `username`, `email`, and `password`. It also includes pre-save hooks to hash\
    \ the password before saving the user. No further action is needed for the schema.\n\nWe will also need to remove the\
    \ test-user endpoint that currently exists in the `routes/users.js` file as it was only for testing purposes and does\
    \ not relate to authentication:\n\n**routes/users.js** (modified part only)\n```javascript\n// ... other imports and code\
    \ ...\n\n// Comment or remove the test-user route:\n// router.get('/test-user', async (req, res) => {\n//   ... \n// });\n\
    \nmodule.exports = router;\n```\n\nLastly, ensure all necessary dependencies related to user authentication are installed.\
    \ According to the `package.json` provided, we have `bcryptjs` already installed for password hashing. You mentioned using\
    \ `jsonwebtoken` for issuing JWT tokens and `Passport.js` for authentication middleware, so let's ensure they are installed\
    \ (execute from the root directory of your project):\n\n```bash\nnpm install jsonwebtoken passport passport-local\n```\n\
    \nNo changes are needed for `jsonwebtoken` and `Passport.js` at this point since they will be used in the upcoming authentication\
    \ task.\n\nNow the task \"Set up the MongoDB connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing\
    \ for authentication and user data storage\" should be fully working without warnings, and the groundwork for user authentication\
    \ is set."
