  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"AI_HyperLab\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"AI_HyperLab\":\n```\n\"Hyper-Lab\" is an innovative full-stack web application designed\
    \ for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture. It combines a modern graphical user interface with advanced\
    \ functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized Autogen Agents.\nEnhanced Key Features and Functionalities:\n\
    * Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically created for each project based on\
    \ user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a 'boss' and a 'critic'.\n* AI-Generated Agent Images: On user\
    \ request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting their functions and roles within the\
    \ project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization to the user experience.\n* RAG\
    \ Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling them to retain memory and\
    \ learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.\n* Persistent and Concurrent Interactions: The platform\
    \ ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.\n* Graphical\
    \ User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent's name, specialization,\
    \ and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.\n* User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various access levels\
    \ for enhanced security, along with features supporting real-time collaboration on AI projects.\n* Strict Adherence to\
    \ Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI services or frameworks.\n\
    * Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages, catering to\
    \ a global audience.\n* Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet to be established,\
    \ the application is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be provided in English.\n\
    References and Resources for Autogen:\n* Autogen Architecture Overview: Microsoft Autogen Blog\n* Agent AutoBuild Example:\
    \ Microsoft Autogen Blog - Agent AutoBuild\n* Detailed Articles on Autogen: Available at Microsoft Autogen Blog.\n\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- MongoDB\n- Mongoose\n\
    - jsonwebtoken\n- Passport.js\n- bcryptjs\n- Socket.io\n- React\n- Redux\n- axios\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- cron\n\
    - i18next\n- TensorFlow.js\n- sharp\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the\
    \ list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies including\
    \ Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.\n\n2. Set up the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user data storage.\n\
    \n3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes for registration,\
    \ login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.\n\n4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality with up to\
    \ eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas and controllers.\n\n5. Integrate TensorFlow.js for Retrievable\
    \ and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory and learn over time.\n\n6. Develop the GUI\
    \ for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the ability to upload\
    \ or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.\n\n7. Implement real-time collaboration features with Socket.io,\
    \ allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different user sessions.\n\n8. Add multilingual support and a mobile-responsive\
    \ design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters to a global audience.\n\n9. Finalize the application\
    \ by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user manual in English.\n\n\

  content: "Given the information provided and the specific issue your colleague is facing, we can infer the following issues:\n\
    \n1. The colleague tried to access `/test-user` and received a \"Cannot GET /test-user\" error. This suggests that they\
    \ hit the wrong endpoint or the routing to the endpoint is misconfigured.\n\n2. There is no data in the USER table in\
    \ MongoDB, which is expected because we have no endpoint to insert data into the USER table yet.\n\nHere's how to address\
    \ the issues:\n\n1. How to fix the \"Cannot GET /test-user\" issue:\n\nEnsure that the `/test-user` endpoint is defined\
    \ in the correct file. It appears that the colleague is not accessing the right URL based on the current routes configuration.\
    \ The `/test-user` endpoint is set up in the `routes/users.js` file, so the correct URL to access this test endpoint should\
    \ be `/users/test-user`:\n\nTest the correct endpoint with the following `curl` command:\n```\ncurl http://localhost:3000/users/test-user\n\
    ```\n\nIf you wish to allow the `/test-user` path from the base URL, you would need to change the `routes/index.js` to\
    \ include a route for `/test-user`. However, it seems that defining it under the `/users` path is intended.\n   \n2. Address\
    \ the lack of data in the USER table:\n\na. Currently, there is no explicit insertion of data into the USER table as described\
    \ in the assigned task. Registration of users is facilitated through the `/auth/register` endpoint provided in the `routes/auth.js`\
    \ file. You can use the following `curl` command to register a new user and consequently create an entry in the USER table:\n\
    ```\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n-d '{\"username\":\"\
    testuser\", \"email\":\"testuser@example.com\", \"password\":\"password123\"}'\n```\n\nMake sure you pass valid JSON in\
    \ the body of the request.\n\nSince the file structure and endpoint are correctly configured as per the task requirements\
    \ (except for the misunderstanding of the `/test-user` endpoint access), the debugging and implementation for this task\
    \ are complete.\n\nRemember that your colleague should use the `/auth/register` endpoint to create new users. That's the\
    \ way User data will end up in the USER table in MongoDB. More detailed error handling and input validation might need\
    \ to be implemented later, but that goes beyond the scope of the current task."

    \n`command` step will run a command on the machine and will return the CLI output to you so you can see what to do next.\
    \ Note that the command will be run on a Darwin machine.\n\n`code_change` step will change the code and you need to thoroughly\
    \ describe what needs to be implemented. I will implement the requested changes and let you know.\n\nAlso, make sure that\
    \ at least the last step has `check_if_fixed` set to TRUE.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should\
    \ the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in\
    \ one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n"
