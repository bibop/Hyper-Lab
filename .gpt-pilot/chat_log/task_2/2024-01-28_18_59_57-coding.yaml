  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"AI_HyperLab\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks\
    \ that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"\
    AI_HyperLab\" as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"AI_HyperLab\":\n```\n\"Hyper-Lab\" is an innovative full-stack\
    \ web application designed for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture. It combines a modern graphical user\
    \ interface with advanced functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized Autogen Agents.\nEnhanced Key\
    \ Features and Functionalities:\n* Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically\
    \ created for each project based on user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a 'boss' and a 'critic'.\n\
    * AI-Generated Agent Images: On user request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting\
    \ their functions and roles within the project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization\
    \ to the user experience.\n* RAG Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling\
    \ them to retain memory and learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.\n* Persistent and Concurrent Interactions:\
    \ The platform ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.\n\
    * Graphical User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent's name,\
    \ specialization, and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.\n* User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various\
    \ access levels for enhanced security, along with features supporting real-time collaboration on AI projects.\n* Strict\
    \ Adherence to Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI services\
    \ or frameworks.\n* Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages,\
    \ catering to a global audience.\n* Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet\
    \ to be established, the application is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be\
    \ provided in English.\nReferences and Resources for Autogen:\n* Autogen Architecture Overview: Microsoft Autogen Blog\n\
    * Agent AutoBuild Example: Microsoft Autogen Blog - Agent AutoBuild\n* Detailed Articles on Autogen: Available at Microsoft\
    \ Autogen Blog.\n\n```\n\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- Node.js\n\n- Express\n\
    \n- MongoDB\n\n- Mongoose\n\n- jsonwebtoken\n\n- Passport.js\n\n- bcryptjs\n\n- Socket.io\n\n- React\n\n- Redux\n\n- axios\n\
    \n- Bootstrap\n\n- HTML\n\n- CSS3\n\n- cron\n\n- i18next\n\n- TensorFlow.js\n\n- sharp\n\n```\n\n\n\n\nSo far, this code\
    \ has been implemented:\n\n**/package.json**\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"ai_hyperlab\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\"\
    : \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"directories\": {\n    \"test\": \"tests\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\"\

    ```\nconst express = require('express');\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port\
    \ = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\napp.get('/ping', (req, res) => {\n  res.status(200).send('OK');\n});\n\napp.listen(port,\
    \ () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n\n\n\nWe've broken the development of this\
    \ app down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies\
    \ including Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.\n\n2. Set up the\
    \ MongoDB connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user\
    \ data storage.\n\n3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes\
    \ for registration, login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.\n\n4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality\
    \ with up to eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas and controllers.\n\n5. Integrate TensorFlow.js\
    \ for Retrievable and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory and learn over time.\n\n\
    6. Develop the GUI for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the\
    \ ability to upload or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.\n\n7. Implement real-time collaboration features\
    \ with Socket.io, allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different user sessions.\n\n8. Add multilingual support\
    \ and a mobile-responsive design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters to a global audience.\n\n\
    9. Finalize the application by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user\
    \ manual in English.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working on task #2 with the following description:\n```\nSet up the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user data storage.\n\
    ```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.\nAfter all the code is finished, a human developer\
    \ will check if the app works this way - `The presence of the user schema in the database can be verified and a dummy\
    \ user can be stored and retrieved without errors.`\n\nNow, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement\
    \ ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n\
    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\n\
    You do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will\
    \ be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port\
    \ 5000 to run the app, it's reserved."

  content: "To complete task #2, you will need to set up the MongoDB connection and create the initial user schema and model\
    \ using Mongoose. Below is the code needed for this task, along with the commands to run.\n\nFirstly, you will have to\
    \ install MongoDB and Mongoose if you haven't done so already. Assuming you have Node.js installed, you can do this by\
    \ running the following command:\n\n```sh\nnpm install mongoose\n```\n\nThen, you will need to update your project with\
    \ the following code:\n\n**/models/User.js**\n```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst Schema = mongoose.Schema;\n\
    \n// User Schema Definition\nconst UserSchema = new Schema({\n  username: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n\
    \    unique: true,\n    trim: true\n  },\n  email: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n    unique: true,\n    trim:\
    \ true,\n    lowercase: true\n  },\n  password: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  },\n  createdAt: {\n    type:\
    \ Date,\n    default: Date.now\n  },\n  updatedAt: {\n    type: Date,\n    default: Date.now\n  }\n});\n\n// Create User\
    \ Model from the Schema\nconst User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);\n\nmodule.exports = User;\n```\n\n**/config/database.js**\n\
    ```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  mongoURI: 'YOUR_MONGODB_URI' // Replace with your own MongoDB URI\n};\n```\n\n**/index.js**\n\
    ```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst databaseConfig = require('./config/database');\n\
    \nconst app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\n// Database Connection\nmongoose.connect(databaseConfig.mongoURI,\
    \ { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })\n.then(() => console.log('MongoDB Connected'))\n.catch(err => console.log(err));\n\
    \n// Requiring User model\nconst User = require('./models/User');\n\napp.get('/ping', (req, res) => {\n  res.status(200).send('OK');\n\
    });\n\n// ...\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nMake sure\
    \ to replace `'YOUR_MONGODB_URI'` in the database.js file with your actual MongoDB URI.\n\nFinally, after you have the\
    \ MongoDB connection and user schema set up, you might want to create a test endpoint to verify that a dummy user can\
    \ be stored and retrieved without errors.\n\nYou can modify the existing `/index.js` to include this test endpoint as\
    \ shown below:\n\n**/index.js** (Appending to the existing file)\n```javascript\n// ...\n\n// Test Endpoint to Create\
    \ and Retrieve a Dummy User\napp.get('/test-user', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    // Create a dummy user\n    const\
    \ dummyUser = new User({\n      username: 'testuser',\n      email: 'testuser@example.com',\n      password: 'password'\
    \ // Note: In production, this would be hashed\n    });\n\n    // Save dummy user in the database\n    await dummyUser.save();\n\
    \n    // Retrieve the dummy user from the database\n    const foundUser = await User.findOne({ username: 'testuser' });\n\
    \    res.status(200).json(foundUser);\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).send(error);\n  }\n});\n\n// ...\n```\n\
    \nThis test endpoint is for development purposes and should not be included in the production code. It allows you to quickly\
    \ verify that a user can be created and fetched from the MongoDB database. Don't forget that in a real application, passwords\
    \ should be hashed before storing them in the database.\n\nWith this setup, you'll be ready to check off task #2. After\
    \ running your server with `npm start` or `node index.js`, you can navigate to the `/test-user` endpoint in your browser\
    \ or use a tool like Postman to create and fetch a dummy user. If the user is created and retrieved successfully, the\
    \ task is completed from a programmatic perspective."

    Add MongoDB connection setup using Mongoose to the existing /index.js file right after the `const app = express();` declaration.\
    \ Also, add the requirement for the User model and a test endpoint to create and retrieve a dummy user.\n\nAdd the following\

    ----------------------end_of_instructions-----------------------------\n\nI want you to implement the instructions and\
    \ show me the exact changes (`diff`) in the file `/index.js`. Reply only with the modifications (`diff`) in the following\
    \ format:\n-----------------------format----------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n```\n(All lines of code from specific\
    \ code block in the current file that will be replaced by the code under NEW_CODE.)\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\n(All lines of\
    \ code that will replace the code under CURRENT_CODE. That includes new lines of code and old lines of code that are not\
    \ being changed but are part of that code block.)\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_format---------------------------\n\
    **IMPORTANT**\nHere are rules how to give good response. You have to strictly follow all rules at all times:\n\nRule #1:\n\
    This is most important rule and there must never be reason to break this rule!\nWhen the instructions contain hints such\
    \ as `# .. insert existing code here ...`, it is imperative to interpret and insert the relevant code from the original.\
    \ Never omit any code that belongs in the new block, and never replace any code with comments such as `// the rest of\
    \ the code goes here`, '# existing code from another file', or similar, even if the instructions explicitly request it!\n\
    If the instruction examples reference existing code to be pasted in place, always use the specified code from the previous\
    \ messages in this conversation instead of copying the comment, as illustrated in the following example:\n------------------------example_1---------------------------\n\
    Instructions: \"Rename function increase() { // ... existing code } to function inc() { // ... existing code } and increase\
    \ counter by 10 instead of 1.\"\n------------------------BAD response for example_1:---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nfunction increase() {\n   // ... existing code\n}\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nfunction inc() {\n   // ... existing code\n\
    \  return value + 10;\n}\n```\n------------------------GOOD response for example_1:---------------------------\n\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nfunction increase(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'number') {\n    throw new Error('Argument must be number');\n\
    \  }\n  return value + 1;\n}\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nfunction inc(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'number') {\n    throw\
    \ new Error('Argument must be number');\n  }\n  return value + 10;\n}\nEND\n```\n------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------\n\
    \nRule #2:\nFor each change that needs to be done, you must show exactly one CURRENT_CODE code block and one NEW_CODE\
    \ code block. You can think of this as difference (`diff`) between the current implementation and the new implementation.\n\
    If there are no lines of code that need to be replaced by the NEW_CODE (if the NEW_CODE needs to be added into the CURRENT_CODE),\
    \ show a couple of lines of code in the CURRENT_CODE before the place where NEW_CODE needs to be added.\nHere is an example\
    \ of how to add one line `i--;` in the for loop:\n------------------------example_2---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nlet i = 0;\ni++;\nfor (let j = 0; j < 100; j++) {\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nlet i = 0;\ni++;\nfor (let j = 0; j < 100;\
    \ j++) {\n    i--;\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------\n\nHere's an example\
    \ how to add code to the beginning of the file:\n------------------------example_3---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nconst app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nconst express = require('express');\n\
    const app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------\n\
    \nRule #3:\nDo not show the entire file under CURRENT_CODE and NEW_CODE but only the lines that need to be replaced. If\
    \ any lines should be left as they are in CURRENT_CODE, do not write them.\n\nRule #4:\nYou must output the CURRENT_CODE\
    \ exactly as it is in the original file, including the indentation from the original code, as it will be used for search-replace,\
    \ and it should only match the original file in ONE place.\nIn the NEW_CODE, remember to follow the same coding style\
    \ that is used in the rest of the file. Pay special attention to the indentation of the new code and make sure to include\
    \ all the required old and new code, without omitting anything.\nPay very close attention to parenthesis and make sure\
    \ that when CURRENT_CODE is replaced with NEW_CODE there are no extra parenthesis or any parenthesis missing.\n"
