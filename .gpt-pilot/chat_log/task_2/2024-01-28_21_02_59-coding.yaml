  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"AI_HyperLab\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"AI_HyperLab\":\n```\n\"Hyper-Lab\" is an innovative full-stack web application designed\
    \ for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture. It combines a modern graphical user interface with advanced\
    \ functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized Autogen Agents.\nEnhanced Key Features and Functionalities:\n\
    * Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically created for each project based on\
    \ user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a 'boss' and a 'critic'.\n* AI-Generated Agent Images: On user\
    \ request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting their functions and roles within the\
    \ project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization to the user experience.\n* RAG\
    \ Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling them to retain memory and\
    \ learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.\n* Persistent and Concurrent Interactions: The platform\
    \ ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.\n* Graphical\
    \ User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent's name, specialization,\
    \ and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.\n* User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various access levels\
    \ for enhanced security, along with features supporting real-time collaboration on AI projects.\n* Strict Adherence to\
    \ Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI services or frameworks.\n\
    * Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages, catering to\
    \ a global audience.\n* Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet to be established,\
    \ the application is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be provided in English.\n\
    References and Resources for Autogen:\n* Autogen Architecture Overview: Microsoft Autogen Blog\n* Agent AutoBuild Example:\
    \ Microsoft Autogen Blog - Agent AutoBuild\n* Detailed Articles on Autogen: Available at Microsoft Autogen Blog.\n\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- MongoDB\n- Mongoose\n\
    - jsonwebtoken\n- Passport.js\n- bcryptjs\n- Socket.io\n- React\n- Redux\n- axios\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- cron\n\
    - i18next\n- TensorFlow.js\n- sharp\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the\
    \ list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies including\
    \ Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.\n\n2. Set up the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user data storage.\n\
    \n3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes for registration,\
    \ login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.\n\n4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality with up to\
    \ eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas and controllers.\n\n5. Integrate TensorFlow.js for Retrievable\
    \ and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory and learn over time.\n\n6. Develop the GUI\
    \ for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the ability to upload\
    \ or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.\n\n7. Implement real-time collaboration features with Socket.io,\
    \ allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different user sessions.\n\n8. Add multilingual support and a mobile-responsive\
    \ design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters to a global audience.\n\n9. Finalize the application\
    \ by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user manual in English.\n\n\

    \ a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any\
    \ automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related\
    \ - only if some dependencies need to be installed."
- role: assistant
  content: 'Based on the information provided, your colleague attempted to access the `/test-user` endpoint without the `/users`
    prefix and received an error. The correct request to access the endpoint is `http://localhost:3000/users/test-user`, as
    indicated by the successful response returned. Therefore, from a code perspective, there doesn''t appear to be a bug with
    the endpoint definition in `routes/users.js`.


    However, from a modular code perspective, the `routes/users.js` file and `routes/auth.js` file are growing, and this is
    not compliant with the requirement to split files that contain more than 50 lines of code. You might want to further modularize
    your routes by separating authentication-related endpoints into a dedicated router file and keeping user-related endpoints
    separate, but since the current lines do not exceed 50, we don''t need to split them yet.


    Regarding the current task "Set up the MongoDB connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model,"
    you have set up the MongoDB connection appropriately, and the `User` schema and model have been created in `models/User.js`.
    Furthermore, the password hashing functionality has been implemented as a pre-save hook in the User Schema.


    Please check if the database connection is truly successful by interacting with the `/test-db` endpoint that''s presumably
    intended to test the MongoDB connection. If that endpoint returns a successful connection message and user count, your
    MongoDB setup and User model code are set up correctly.


    Since the given information does not indicate that there are any issues with the MongoDB setup nor model creation, it
    appears that the current task is fully working as expected and does not require any additional code to be written or dependencies
    to be installed.


    Nonetheless, here''s a quick recap of the deliverables that you should have for this task:


    1. A MongoDB connection setup in `config/database.js`.

    2. A User schema and model in `models/User.js` with appropriate fields and password hashing middleware.

    3. A `/test-db` endpoint within `routes/users.js` that confirms successful database connection and reports the number
    of documents in the `User` collection.


    No additional installation commands are needed as the dependencies are already specified in `package.json`.


    For completeness, ensure that your `.env` file with the `MONGO_URI` variable is set correctly and the MongoDB instance
    is running, but remember to keep `.env` out of version control for security purposes.


    Finally, always ensure that any new response messages or text that you add to the files that may influence the frontend
    user experience should be clear and user-friendly, which will contribute positively towards the user-review goal.'

    CURRENT_CODE:\n```\n(All lines of code from specific code block in the current file that will be replaced by the code\

    \ new lines of code and old lines of code that are not being changed but are part of that code block.)\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_format---------------------------\n\
    **IMPORTANT**\nHere are rules how to give good response. You have to strictly follow all rules at all times:\n\nRule #1:\n\
    This is most important rule and there must never be reason to break this rule!\nWhen the instructions contain hints such\
    \ as `# .. insert existing code here ...`, it is imperative to interpret and insert the relevant code from the original.\
    \ Never omit any code that belongs in the new block, and never replace any code with comments such as `// the rest of\
    \ the code goes here`, '# existing code from another file', or similar, even if the instructions explicitly request it!\n\
    If the instruction examples reference existing code to be pasted in place, always use the specified code from the previous\
    \ messages in this conversation instead of copying the comment, as illustrated in the following example:\n------------------------example_1---------------------------\n\
    Instructions: \"Rename function increase() { // ... existing code } to function inc() { // ... existing code } and increase\
    \ counter by 10 instead of 1.\"\n------------------------BAD response for example_1:---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nfunction increase() {\n   // ... existing code\n}\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nfunction inc() {\n   // ... existing code\n\
    \  return value + 10;\n}\n```\n------------------------GOOD response for example_1:---------------------------\n\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nfunction increase(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'number') {\n    throw new Error('Argument must be number');\n\
    \  }\n  return value + 1;\n}\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nfunction inc(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'number') {\n    throw\
    \ new Error('Argument must be number');\n  }\n  return value + 10;\n}\nEND\n```\n------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------\n\
    \nRule #2:\nFor each change that needs to be done, you must show exactly one CURRENT_CODE code block and one NEW_CODE\
    \ code block. You can think of this as difference (`diff`) between the current implementation and the new implementation.\n\
    If there are no lines of code that need to be replaced by the NEW_CODE (if the NEW_CODE needs to be added into the CURRENT_CODE),\
    \ show a couple of lines of code in the CURRENT_CODE before the place where NEW_CODE needs to be added.\nHere is an example\
    \ of how to add one line `i--;` in the for loop:\n------------------------example_2---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nlet i = 0;\ni++;\nfor (let j = 0; j < 100; j++) {\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nlet i = 0;\ni++;\nfor (let j = 0; j < 100;\
    \ j++) {\n    i--;\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------\n\nHere's an example\
    \ how to add code to the beginning of the file:\n------------------------example_3---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nconst app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nconst express = require('express');\n\
    const app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------\n\
    \nRule #3:\nDo not show the entire file under CURRENT_CODE and NEW_CODE but only the lines that need to be replaced. If\
    \ any lines should be left as they are in CURRENT_CODE, do not write them.\n\nRule #4:\nYou must output the CURRENT_CODE\
    \ exactly as it is in the original file, including the indentation from the original code, as it will be used for search-replace,\
    \ and it should only match the original file in ONE place.\nIn the NEW_CODE, remember to follow the same coding style\
    \ that is used in the rest of the file. Pay special attention to the indentation of the new code and make sure to include\
    \ all the required old and new code, without omitting anything.\nPay very close attention to parenthesis and make sure\
    \ that when CURRENT_CODE is replaced with NEW_CODE there are no extra parenthesis or any parenthesis missing.\n"
response: 'CURRENT_CODE:

  ```

  console.log(`Server is running on port ${process.env.PORT}`);

  NEW_CODE:
