  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"AI_HyperLab\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"AI_HyperLab\":\n```\n\"Hyper-Lab\" is an innovative full-stack web application designed\
    \ for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture. It combines a modern graphical user interface with advanced\
    \ functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized Autogen Agents.\nEnhanced Key Features and Functionalities:\n\
    * Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically created for each project based on\
    \ user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a 'boss' and a 'critic'.\n* AI-Generated Agent Images: On user\
    \ request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting their functions and roles within the\
    \ project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization to the user experience.\n* RAG\
    \ Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling them to retain memory and\
    \ learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.\n* Persistent and Concurrent Interactions: The platform\
    \ ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.\n* Graphical\
    \ User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent's name, specialization,\
    \ and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.\n* User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various access levels\
    \ for enhanced security, along with features supporting real-time collaboration on AI projects.\n* Strict Adherence to\
    \ Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI services or frameworks.\n\
    * Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages, catering to\
    \ a global audience.\n* Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet to be established,\
    \ the application is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be provided in English.\n\
    References and Resources for Autogen:\n* Autogen Architecture Overview: Microsoft Autogen Blog\n* Agent AutoBuild Example:\
    \ Microsoft Autogen Blog - Agent AutoBuild\n* Detailed Articles on Autogen: Available at Microsoft Autogen Blog.\n\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- MongoDB\n- Mongoose\n\
    - jsonwebtoken\n- Passport.js\n- bcryptjs\n- Socket.io\n- React\n- Redux\n- axios\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- cron\n\
    - i18next\n- TensorFlow.js\n- sharp\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the\
    \ list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies including\
    \ Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.\n\n2. Set up the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user data storage.\n\
    \n3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes for registration,\
    \ login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.\n\n4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality with up to\
    \ eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas and controllers.\n\n5. Integrate TensorFlow.js for Retrievable\
    \ and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory and learn over time.\n\n6. Develop the GUI\
    \ for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the ability to upload\
    \ or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.\n\n7. Implement real-time collaboration features with Socket.io,\
    \ allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different user sessions.\n\n8. Add multilingual support and a mobile-responsive\
    \ design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters to a global audience.\n\n9. Finalize the application\
    \ by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user manual in English.\n\n\

    \ GET /user/test-user</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n(base) bibop@BibopNewMacBook ai_hyperlab % \n\n```\n\nCan you debug this\
    \ issue or implement changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new code that needs to be written\
    \ or modified to implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment is set up previously\
    \ and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if\
    \ there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make\
    \ files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too\
    \ large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\
    \n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies\
    \ need to be installed."

  content: "It looks like there is a typo in the curl command provided by your colleague, and potentially an issue with how\
    \ the routes were set up in the `routes/index.js` file. The route your colleague is trying to access should be `/users/test-user`\
    \ instead of `/user/test-user` as defined in `routes/index.js` and `routes/users.js`. Here's what needs to be fixed:\n\
    \n1. Instruct your colleague to use the correct URL with the plural `users` in the curl request:\n```\ncurl http://localhost:3000/users/test-user\n\
    ```\n\n2. Additionally, there is an endpoint `/test-user` in `routes/users.js`, but it's only sending back a message without\
    \ performing some operations. It\u2019s not complete. However, to comply with the requirements, the endpoint should be\
    \ working as expected and return the message when accessed with the corrected URL.\n\n3. Since you have a requirement\
    \ to keep files small and modular, make sure that the `routes/users.js` doesn't exceed the limit. Currently, it doesn't,\
    \ but keep this in mind as you continue to add to it.\n\nThere's no new code that needs to be written for this task specifically.\
    \ All you need to do is communicate the correct endpoint to your colleague, and if any changes are required in the code,\
    \ it would only involve the debug information. The rest of the code is modular and does not exceed the 50-line limit.\n\
    \nYou don't need to install any new packages as all required dependencies are already in place and specified in the `package.json`.\n\
    \nRemember to remind your colleague to restart the server if any changes were made to the backend code, as Node.js does\
    \ not automatically pick up changes without a restart. The command to start the server is:\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nIf\
    \ you do find you need to split files due to the 50 line limit in the future, you can create new modules by extracting\
    \ related functions into separate files and importing them where they're needed with `require()`. This keeps the codebase\
    \ clean and maintainable."
