  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"AI_HyperLab\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"AI_HyperLab\":\n```\n\"Hyper-Lab\" is an innovative full-stack web application designed\
    \ for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture. It combines a modern graphical user interface with advanced\
    \ functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized Autogen Agents.\nEnhanced Key Features and Functionalities:\n\
    * Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically created for each project based on\
    \ user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a 'boss' and a 'critic'.\n* AI-Generated Agent Images: On user\
    \ request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting their functions and roles within the\
    \ project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization to the user experience.\n* RAG\
    \ Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling them to retain memory and\
    \ learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.\n* Persistent and Concurrent Interactions: The platform\
    \ ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.\n* Graphical\
    \ User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent's name, specialization,\
    \ and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.\n* User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various access levels\
    \ for enhanced security, along with features supporting real-time collaboration on AI projects.\n* Strict Adherence to\
    \ Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI services or frameworks.\n\
    * Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages, catering to\
    \ a global audience.\n* Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet to be established,\
    \ the application is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be provided in English.\n\
    References and Resources for Autogen:\n* Autogen Architecture Overview: Microsoft Autogen Blog\n* Agent AutoBuild Example:\
    \ Microsoft Autogen Blog - Agent AutoBuild\n* Detailed Articles on Autogen: Available at Microsoft Autogen Blog.\n\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- MongoDB\n- Mongoose\n\
    - jsonwebtoken\n- Passport.js\n- bcryptjs\n- Socket.io\n- React\n- Redux\n- axios\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- cron\n\
    - i18next\n- TensorFlow.js\n- sharp\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the\
    \ list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies including\
    \ Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.\n\n2. Set up the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user data storage.\n\
    \n3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes for registration,\
    \ login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.\n\n4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality with up to\
    \ eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas and controllers.\n\n5. Integrate TensorFlow.js for Retrievable\
    \ and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory and learn over time.\n\n6. Develop the GUI\
    \ for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the ability to upload\
    \ or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.\n\n7. Implement real-time collaboration features with Socket.io,\
    \ allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different user sessions.\n\n8. Add multilingual support and a mobile-responsive\
    \ design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters to a global audience.\n\n9. Finalize the application\
    \ by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user manual in English.\n\n\

    \ up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies,\
    \ if there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make\
    \ files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too\
    \ large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\
    \n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies\
    \ need to be installed."
- role: assistant
  content: "The error message your colleague is encountering indicates that the port `3000` that the application is trying\
    \ to use is already in use by another process. This is a common issue that can happen if you have another instance of\
    \ the application running, or if a different application is using the same port.\n\nThere are a few ways to resolve this:\n\
    \n1. Find and terminate the process that's using port `3000`. This can often be done using a command like `lsof -i tcp:3000`\
    \ to locate the process, and then `kill -9 <PID>` to terminate it, where `<PID>` is the process ID returned from the `lsof`\
    \ command.\n\n2. Change the port number your application uses to something other than `3000`. You can do this by modifying\
    \ the `.env` file or setting the `PORT` environment variable to a different number before you start the application.\n\
    \nAs it's specified to focus on the code changes, here's what you can do in the code to alleviate the issue dynamically:\n\
    \nModify your `index.js` to check if the default `PORT` is available. If not, you can automatically try another port.\
    \ This allows for a fallback to a new port if the default is in use.\n\nHere is how you can modify the `/index.js` file\
    \ to implement this change:\n\n```javascript\n// Other requires...\nconst http = require('http');\n// Existing code...\n\
    \nconst server = http.createServer(app);\n\nserver.listen(port);\nserver.on('error', onError);\nserver.on('listening',\
    \ onListening);\n\nfunction onError(error) {\n  if (error.syscall !== 'listen') {\n    throw error;\n  }\n\n  // Handle\
    \ specific listen errors with friendly messages\n  switch (error.code) {\n    case 'EACCES':\n      console.error(`Port\
    \ ${port} requires elevated privileges`);\n      process.exit(1);\n      break;\n    case 'EADDRINUSE':\n      console.error(`Port\
    \ ${port} is already in use`);\n      // Attempt to use a different port by incrementing the current one\n      server.listen(++port);\n\
    \      break;\n    default:\n      throw error;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction onListening() {\n  const addr = server.address();\n\
    \  console.log(`Server is running on port ${addr.port}`);\n}\n\n// Rest of file...\n```\n\nThis modification introduces\
    \ an event listener for the 'error' event on the server instance, which will call the `onError` function in case an error\
    \ occurs. If the port is already in use, we attempt to listen on the next available port by incrementing the port number.\n\
    \nPlease remember, this dynamic port allocation is generally more suitable for development environments. In production\
    \ environments, it's best to have strict control over which ports are being used and ensure they are configured correctly\
    \ to avoid conflicts."
