  content: "You are working on a App called \"AI_HyperLab\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks\
    \ that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"\
    AI_HyperLab\" as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"AI_HyperLab\":\n```\n\"Hyper-Lab\" is an innovative full-stack\
    \ web application designed for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture. It combines a modern graphical user\
    \ interface with advanced functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized Autogen Agents.\nEnhanced Key\
    \ Features and Functionalities:\n* Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically\
    \ created for each project based on user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a 'boss' and a 'critic'.\n\
    * AI-Generated Agent Images: On user request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting\
    \ their functions and roles within the project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization\
    \ to the user experience.\n* RAG Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling\
    \ them to retain memory and learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.\n* Persistent and Concurrent Interactions:\
    \ The platform ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.\n\
    * Graphical User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent's name,\
    \ specialization, and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.\n* User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various\
    \ access levels for enhanced security, along with features supporting real-time collaboration on AI projects.\n* Strict\
    \ Adherence to Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI services\
    \ or frameworks.\n* Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages,\
    \ catering to a global audience.\n* Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet\
    \ to be established, the application is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be\
    \ provided in English.\nReferences and Resources for Autogen:\n* Autogen Architecture Overview: Microsoft Autogen Blog\n\
    * Agent AutoBuild Example: Microsoft Autogen Blog - Agent AutoBuild\n* Detailed Articles on Autogen: Available at Microsoft\
    \ Autogen Blog.\n\n```\n\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- Node.js\n\n- Express\n\
    \n- MongoDB\n\n- Mongoose\n\n- jsonwebtoken\n\n- Passport.js\n\n- bcryptjs\n\n- Socket.io\n\n- React\n\n- Redux\n\n- axios\n\
    \n- Bootstrap\n\n- HTML\n\n- CSS3\n\n- cron\n\n- i18next\n\n- TensorFlow.js\n\n- sharp\n\n```\n\n\n\n\nSo far, this code\
    \ has been implemented:\n\n**/package.json**\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"ai_hyperlab\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\"\
    : \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"directories\": {\n    \"test\": \"tests\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\"\

    \ () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n\n\n\nWe've broken the development of this\
    \ app down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies\
    \ including Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.\n\n2. Set up the\
    \ MongoDB connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user\
    \ data storage.\n\n3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes\
    \ for registration, login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.\n\n4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality\
    \ with up to eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas and controllers.\n\n5. Integrate TensorFlow.js\
    \ for Retrievable and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory and learn over time.\n\n\
    6. Develop the GUI for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the\
    \ ability to upload or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.\n\n7. Implement real-time collaboration features\
    \ with Socket.io, allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different user sessions.\n\n8. Add multilingual support\
    \ and a mobile-responsive design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters to a global audience.\n\n\
    9. Finalize the application by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user\
    \ manual in English.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working on task #2 with the following description:\n```\nSet up the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user data storage.\n\
    ```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.\nAfter all the code is finished, a human developer\
    \ will check if the app works this way - `The presence of the user schema in the database can be verified and a dummy\
    \ user can be stored and retrieved without errors.`\n\nNow, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement\
    \ ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n\
    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\n\
    You do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will\
    \ be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port\
    \ 5000 to run the app, it's reserved."
response: "To complete task #2, you will need to set up the MongoDB connection and create the initial user schema and model\
  \ using Mongoose. Below is the code needed for this task, along with the commands to run.\n\nFirstly, you will have to install\
  \ MongoDB and Mongoose if you haven't done so already. Assuming you have Node.js installed, you can do this by running the\
  \ following command:\n\n```sh\nnpm install mongoose\n```\n\nThen, you will need to update your project with the following\
  \ code:\n\n**/models/User.js**\n```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst Schema = mongoose.Schema;\n\n\
  // User Schema Definition\nconst UserSchema = new Schema({\n  username: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n    unique:\
  \ true,\n    trim: true\n  },\n  email: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n    unique: true,\n    trim: true,\n\
  \    lowercase: true\n  },\n  password: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  },\n  createdAt: {\n    type: Date,\n\
  \    default: Date.now\n  },\n  updatedAt: {\n    type: Date,\n    default: Date.now\n  }\n});\n\n// Create User Model from\
  \ the Schema\nconst User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);\n\nmodule.exports = User;\n```\n\n**/config/database.js**\n\
  ```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  mongoURI: 'YOUR_MONGODB_URI' // Replace with your own MongoDB URI\n};\n```\n\n**/index.js**\n\
  ```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst databaseConfig = require('./config/database');\n\
  \nconst app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\n// Database Connection\nmongoose.connect(databaseConfig.mongoURI,\
  \ { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })\n.then(() => console.log('MongoDB Connected'))\n.catch(err => console.log(err));\n\
  \n// Requiring User model\nconst User = require('./models/User');\n\napp.get('/ping', (req, res) => {\n  res.status(200).send('OK');\n\
  });\n\n// ...\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nMake sure to\
  \ replace `'YOUR_MONGODB_URI'` in the database.js file with your actual MongoDB URI.\n\nFinally, after you have the MongoDB\
  \ connection and user schema set up, you might want to create a test endpoint to verify that a dummy user can be stored\
  \ and retrieved without errors.\n\nYou can modify the existing `/index.js` to include this test endpoint as shown below:\n\
  \n**/index.js** (Appending to the existing file)\n```javascript\n// ...\n\n// Test Endpoint to Create and Retrieve a Dummy\
  \ User\napp.get('/test-user', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    // Create a dummy user\n    const dummyUser = new User({\n\
  \      username: 'testuser',\n      email: 'testuser@example.com',\n      password: 'password' // Note: In production, this\
  \ would be hashed\n    });\n\n    // Save dummy user in the database\n    await dummyUser.save();\n\n    // Retrieve the\
  \ dummy user from the database\n    const foundUser = await User.findOne({ username: 'testuser' });\n    res.status(200).json(foundUser);\n\
  \  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).send(error);\n  }\n});\n\n// ...\n```\n\nThis test endpoint is for development\
  \ purposes and should not be included in the production code. It allows you to quickly verify that a user can be created\
  \ and fetched from the MongoDB database. Don't forget that in a real application, passwords should be hashed before storing\
  \ them in the database.\n\nWith this setup, you'll be ready to check off task #2. After running your server with `npm start`\
  \ or `node index.js`, you can navigate to the `/test-user` endpoint in your browser or use a tool like Postman to create\
  \ and fetch a dummy user. If the user is created and retrieved successfully, the task is completed from a programmatic perspective."
