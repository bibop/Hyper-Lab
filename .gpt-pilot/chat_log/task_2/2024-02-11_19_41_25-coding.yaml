  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"AI_HyperLab\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"AI_HyperLab\":\n```\n\"Hyper-Lab\" is an innovative full-stack web application designed\
    \ for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture. It combines a modern graphical user interface with advanced\
    \ functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized Autogen Agents.\nEnhanced Key Features and Functionalities:\n\
    * Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically created for each project based on\
    \ user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a 'boss' and a 'critic'.\n* AI-Generated Agent Images: On user\
    \ request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting their functions and roles within the\
    \ project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization to the user experience.\n* RAG\
    \ Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling them to retain memory and\
    \ learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.\n* Persistent and Concurrent Interactions: The platform\
    \ ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.\n* Graphical\
    \ User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent's name, specialization,\
    \ and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.\n* User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various access levels\
    \ for enhanced security, along with features supporting real-time collaboration on AI projects.\n* Strict Adherence to\
    \ Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI services or frameworks.\n\
    * Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages, catering to\
    \ a global audience.\n* Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet to be established,\
    \ the application is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be provided in English.\n\
    References and Resources for Autogen:\n* Autogen Architecture Overview: Microsoft Autogen Blog\n* Agent AutoBuild Example:\
    \ Microsoft Autogen Blog - Agent AutoBuild\n* Detailed Articles on Autogen: Available at Microsoft Autogen Blog.\n\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- MongoDB\n- Mongoose\n\
    - jsonwebtoken\n- Passport.js\n- bcryptjs\n- Socket.io\n- React\n- Redux\n- axios\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- cron\n\
    - i18next\n- TensorFlow.js\n- sharp\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the\
    \ list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies including\
    \ Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.\n\n2. Set up the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user data storage.\n\
    \n3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes for registration,\
    \ login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.\n\n4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality with up to\
    \ eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas and controllers.\n\n5. Integrate TensorFlow.js for Retrievable\
    \ and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory and learn over time.\n\n6. Develop the GUI\
    \ for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the ability to upload\
    \ or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.\n\n7. Implement real-time collaboration features with Socket.io,\
    \ allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different user sessions.\n\n8. Add multilingual support and a mobile-responsive\
    \ design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters to a global audience.\n\n9. Finalize the application\
    \ by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user manual in English.\n\n\

  content: 'The error message "Cannot GET /test-user" implies that there is no handler for the GET request on the endpoint
    `/test-user`. This endpoint is defined in the `routes/users.js` file but the application might not be using these routes
    correctly. Let''s review the setup and make sure that when we hit `/test-user`, we get the expected response.


    Based on what we have in the `routes/index.js` file, it seems like the routes should be loading correctly. However, to
    ensure it works as intended, we should verify the import and usage of the user routes in this file.


    The implementation looks correct; however, as a precaution, make sure that the route maps to `/users/test-user` since
    the `/users` route is a parent route for all routes defined in `routes/users.js`.


    Double-checking if your server should be running on a different port (3000) as defined in the .env:


    ```env

    PORT=3000

    ```


    However, it could be an oversight within the file structure. If your current test is using a different base URL that does
    not include `/users`, then the route `/test-user` will not be found since the correct route should be `/users/test-user`.


    To fix this issue, ensure that when testing the endpoint, the full path should be `/users/test-user`. No change in the
    code is required since the routing seems to be set up correctly.


    Another point to check is whether the file `routes/index.js` where the route handlers are connected to the Express application
    has been correctly required in the `index.js`. However, as we can see from the current `index.js` provided, the routes
    are indeed required.


    Just for a comprehensive overview, if you want to check or test the `/test-user` route, it should be accessed via:


    ```

    http://localhost:3000/users/test-user

    ```


    Remember, since the `.env` file stipulates port 3000, you should ensure your server is running on this port, or adjust
    accordingly to the port you are using.


    No new dependencies are needed, as all required packages have been mentioned and presumably installed. Ensure MongoDB
    is running so that the Mongoose connection can be established. Based on the current task described and assuming the environment
    setup is correct, no further code changes or additional installations are necessary to resolve the reported issue.'

    ```

    Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with

    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code
    in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split
    it into smaller files.
