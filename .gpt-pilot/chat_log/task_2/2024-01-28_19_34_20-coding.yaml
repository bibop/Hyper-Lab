  content: "You are working on a App called \"AI_HyperLab\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"AI_HyperLab\":\n```\n\"Hyper-Lab\" is an innovative full-stack web application designed\
    \ for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture. It combines a modern graphical user interface with advanced\
    \ functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized Autogen Agents.\nEnhanced Key Features and Functionalities:\n\
    * Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically created for each project based on\
    \ user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a 'boss' and a 'critic'.\n* AI-Generated Agent Images: On user\
    \ request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting their functions and roles within the\
    \ project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization to the user experience.\n* RAG\
    \ Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling them to retain memory and\
    \ learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.\n* Persistent and Concurrent Interactions: The platform\
    \ ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.\n* Graphical\
    \ User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent's name, specialization,\
    \ and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.\n* User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various access levels\
    \ for enhanced security, along with features supporting real-time collaboration on AI projects.\n* Strict Adherence to\
    \ Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI services or frameworks.\n\
    * Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages, catering to\
    \ a global audience.\n* Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet to be established,\
    \ the application is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be provided in English.\n\
    References and Resources for Autogen:\n* Autogen Architecture Overview: Microsoft Autogen Blog\n* Agent AutoBuild Example:\
    \ Microsoft Autogen Blog - Agent AutoBuild\n* Detailed Articles on Autogen: Available at Microsoft Autogen Blog.\n\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- MongoDB\n- Mongoose\n\
    - jsonwebtoken\n- Passport.js\n- bcryptjs\n- Socket.io\n- React\n- Redux\n- axios\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- cron\n\
    - i18next\n- TensorFlow.js\n- sharp\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the\
    \ list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies including\
    \ Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.\n\n2. Set up the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user data storage.\n\
    \n3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes for registration,\
    \ login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.\n\n4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality with up to\
    \ eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas and controllers.\n\n5. Integrate TensorFlow.js for Retrievable\
    \ and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory and learn over time.\n\n6. Develop the GUI\
    \ for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the ability to upload\
    \ or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.\n\n7. Implement real-time collaboration features with Socket.io,\
    \ allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different user sessions.\n\n8. Add multilingual support and a mobile-responsive\
    \ design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters to a global audience.\n\n9. Finalize the application\
    \ by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user manual in English.\n\n\

    \nCan you debug this issue or implement changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new code\
    \ that needs to be written or modified to implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment\
    \ is set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of\
    \ new dependencies, if there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to,\
    \ always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever\
    \ a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any\
    \ automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related\
    \ - only if some dependencies need to be installed."
response: "The code provided already handles the creation and retrieval of a test user in MongoDB; however, the reported output\
  \ from the `/test-user` route indicates that the password is being stored as a hashed value, which is the correct behavior\
  \ to protect user information.\n\nTo enhance the current implementation and ensure it aligns with the task description,\
  \ we should make the following changes and additions:\n\n1. **Separation of concerns**: We will refactor the current `index.js`\
  \ to extract route handlers and mongoose model logic into separate directories and files for better maintainability.\n\n\
  2. **Environment Variables**: Rather than hardcoding the MongoDB URI in `config/database.js`, we will use environment variables\
  \ to manage configurations like database connections, which is a standard practice for real-world applications. We will\
  \ utilize the `dotenv` package to manage this.\n\nLet's begin by refactoring the code and setting up our environment variables:\n\
  \n**Installation of `dotenv`**:\n```sh\nnpm install dotenv\n```\n\nYou will then create an `.env` file in the root directory\
  \ to store environment variables. However, since we don't provide actual changes to file system or content of files outside\
  \ of the source code, please create it yourself and ensure it contains:\n\n```env\nMONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ai_hyperlab\n\
  ```\n\nNow, we will refactor the `index.js` and `database.js` files, alongside with creating a new directory for routes.\n\
  \n**/config/database.js**\n```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nconst connectDB = async () => {\n  try\
  \ {\n    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });\n    console.log('MongoDB\
  \ Connected...');\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err.message);\n    // Exit process with failure\n    process.exit(1);\n\
  \  }\n};\n\nmodule.exports = connectDB;\n```\n\n**/index.js**\n```javascript\nrequire('dotenv').config(); // to use environment\
  \ variables from .env\nconst express = require('express');\nconst connectDB = require('./config/database');\n\nconst app\
  \ = express();\n\nconnectDB(); // Establish a database connection\n\napp.use(express.json()); // Middleware for JSON body\
  \ parsing\n\n// Routes\napp.use('/', require('./routes/index'));\napp.use('/users', require('./routes/users')); // User\
  \ routes not yet created\n\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is\
  \ running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nNext, we will create the route handlers in a more modular way.\n\n**/routes/index.js**\n\
  ```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.get('/ping', (req, res) =>\
  \ {\n  res.status(200).send('OK');\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n```\n\n**/routes/users.js** (This is for handling user-related\
  \ routes)\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst router = express.Router();\nconst User = require('../models/User');\n\
  \n// Test Endpoint to Create and Retrieve a Dummy User\nrouter.get('/test-user', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const\
  \ foundUser = await User.findOne({ username: 'testuser' });\n    if(!foundUser) {\n      const dummyUser = new User({\n\
  \        username: 'testuser',\n        email: 'testuser@example.com',\n        password: 'password' // This will be hashed\
  \ by the pre-save middleware\n      });\n      await dummyUser.save();\n      res.status(201).json(dummyUser);\n    } else\
  \ {\n      res.status(200).json(foundUser);\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).send(error);\n  }\n});\n\n\
  module.exports = router;\n```\n\nBy following these steps, we've refactored the application to use environment variables,\
  \ and we have separated the route handling and database connection logic from the `index.js`. Now the `index.js` is more\
  \ focused on setting up the server and less cluttered with other details.\n\nAlso, note that the test-user endpoint now\
  \ checks if a user named 'testuser' already exists, and if so, it returns that user instead of creating a new one. This\
  \ avoids the creation of multiple users with the same username, which would be an incorrect behavior, as 'username' is defined\
  \ as unique in the UserSchema. \n\nMake sure to restart your Node.js server for the changes to take effect."
