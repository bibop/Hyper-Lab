  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"AI_HyperLab\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"AI_HyperLab\":\n```\n\"Hyper-Lab\" is an innovative full-stack web application designed\
    \ for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture. It combines a modern graphical user interface with advanced\
    \ functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized Autogen Agents.\nEnhanced Key Features and Functionalities:\n\
    * Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically created for each project based on\
    \ user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a 'boss' and a 'critic'.\n* AI-Generated Agent Images: On user\
    \ request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting their functions and roles within the\
    \ project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization to the user experience.\n* RAG\
    \ Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling them to retain memory and\
    \ learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.\n* Persistent and Concurrent Interactions: The platform\
    \ ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.\n* Graphical\
    \ User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent's name, specialization,\
    \ and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.\n* User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various access levels\
    \ for enhanced security, along with features supporting real-time collaboration on AI projects.\n* Strict Adherence to\
    \ Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI services or frameworks.\n\
    * Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages, catering to\
    \ a global audience.\n* Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet to be established,\
    \ the application is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be provided in English.\n\
    References and Resources for Autogen:\n* Autogen Architecture Overview: Microsoft Autogen Blog\n* Agent AutoBuild Example:\
    \ Microsoft Autogen Blog - Agent AutoBuild\n* Detailed Articles on Autogen: Available at Microsoft Autogen Blog.\n\n```\n\
    \nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- MongoDB\n- Mongoose\n\
    - jsonwebtoken\n- Passport.js\n- bcryptjs\n- Socket.io\n- React\n- Redux\n- axios\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- cron\n\
    - i18next\n- TensorFlow.js\n- sharp\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the\
    \ list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies including\
    \ Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.\n\n2. Set up the MongoDB\
    \ connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication and user data storage.\n\
    \n3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes for registration,\
    \ login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.\n\n4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality with up to\
    \ eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas and controllers.\n\n5. Integrate TensorFlow.js for Retrievable\
    \ and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory and learn over time.\n\n6. Develop the GUI\
    \ for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the ability to upload\
    \ or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.\n\n7. Implement real-time collaboration features with Socket.io,\
    \ allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different user sessions.\n\n8. Add multilingual support and a mobile-responsive\
    \ design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters to a global audience.\n\n9. Finalize the application\
    \ by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user manual in English.\n\n\

    \nCan you debug this issue or implement changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new code\
    \ that needs to be written or modified to implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment\

    \ new dependencies, if there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to,\
    \ always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever\
    \ a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any\
    \ automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related\

  content: "To address the issue your colleague is facing with the `/test-db` and `/test-user` endpoints, we need to ensure\
    \ that the routes are correctly set up and can be accessed. From the file structure and code provided, we can see that\
    \ a GET request to `/test-db` should be possible through the `routes/users.js` file, but there is no mention of the `/test-user`\
    \ endpoint in the current codebase, so this route does not exist.\n\nThe output that your colleague received when making\
    \ a request to `/test-db` indicates that the endpoint is not accessible, which suggests that there may be issues with\
    \ how the routes are being imported and used in `index.js`. To debug and fix this, here are the steps we should follow:\n\
    \n1. **Ensure proper routing in `index.js`**\n   - You've mentioned that we should keep files small and modular. In this\
    \ spirit, we'll make sure the routes are properly modularized and imported into the `index.js`.\n\nHere's the step related\
    \ to the `index.js`:\n\n**/index.js**\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\
    const connectDB = require('./config/database');\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// Database Connection\nconnectDB().catch(err\
    \ => console.log(err));\n\n// Middleware for parsing JSON and urlencoded form data\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({\
    \ extended: true }));\n\n// Instead of requiring routes here, we'll delegate it to the routing modules\n// Initialize\
    \ routes - this is a new file that we'll create\nrequire('./routes')(app);\n\n// Error handling middleware\nconst errorHandler\
    \ = require('./middleware/errorHandler');\napp.use(errorHandler);\n\napp.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Server\
    \ is running on port ${process.env.PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\n2. **Create a routing module to centralize all route definitions.**\
    \ According to the modular approach, we would create a new file called `routes/index.js` that will initialize all our\
    \ routes.\n\n**/routes/index.js**\n```javascript\nconst userRoutes = require('./users');\nconst authRoutes = require('./auth');\n\
    \nmodule.exports = function(app) {\n  app.use('/users', userRoutes);\n  app.use('/auth', authRoutes);\n\n  // Example\
    \ of health check endpoint, this could replace the '/ping' if needed.\n  app.get('/health', (req, res) => {\n    res.status(200).send('Server\
    \ healthy');\n  });\n};\n```\n\nWith these changes, we should have addressed the missing `/test-db` issue. Since there\
    \ is no mention of the `/test-user` endpoint, I assume it might be a mistake or an old test endpoint that is no longer\
    \ required. Therefore, I have not included a `/test-user` endpoint in the solution.\n\nOnce these changes are implemented,\
    \ inform your colleague to try accessing `http://localhost:3000/users/test-db` again to test the database connection endpoint.\
    \ Remember to restart the Node.js server after making these code changes.\n\nThere are no additional dependencies that\
    \ need to be installed since all required packages were previously listed. Make sure that the MongoDB service is running\
    \ on your system since that's a prerequisite for a successful database connection."

    app.use('/auth', require('./routes/auth'));\n\nWith a single line to require and initialize all routes:\nrequire('./routes')(app);\n\
    \nAlso, change app.listen to use 'process.env.PORT':\napp.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running\

    \ and old lines of code that are not being changed but are part of that code block.)\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_format---------------------------\n\
    **IMPORTANT**\nHere are rules how to give good response. You have to strictly follow all rules at all times:\n\nRule #1:\n\
    This is most important rule and there must never be reason to break this rule!\nWhen the instructions contain hints such\
    \ as `# .. insert existing code here ...`, it is imperative to interpret and insert the relevant code from the original.\
    \ Never omit any code that belongs in the new block, and never replace any code with comments such as `// the rest of\
    \ the code goes here`, '# existing code from another file', or similar, even if the instructions explicitly request it!\n\
    If the instruction examples reference existing code to be pasted in place, always use the specified code from the previous\
    \ messages in this conversation instead of copying the comment, as illustrated in the following example:\n------------------------example_1---------------------------\n\
    Instructions: \"Rename function increase() { // ... existing code } to function inc() { // ... existing code } and increase\
    \ counter by 10 instead of 1.\"\n------------------------BAD response for example_1:---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nfunction increase() {\n   // ... existing code\n}\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nfunction inc() {\n   // ... existing code\n\
    \  return value + 10;\n}\n```\n------------------------GOOD response for example_1:---------------------------\n\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nfunction increase(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'number') {\n    throw new Error('Argument must be number');\n\
    \  }\n  return value + 1;\n}\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nfunction inc(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'number') {\n    throw\
    \ new Error('Argument must be number');\n  }\n  return value + 10;\n}\nEND\n```\n------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------\n\
    \nRule #2:\nFor each change that needs to be done, you must show exactly one CURRENT_CODE code block and one NEW_CODE\
    \ code block. You can think of this as difference (`diff`) between the current implementation and the new implementation.\n\
    If there are no lines of code that need to be replaced by the NEW_CODE (if the NEW_CODE needs to be added into the CURRENT_CODE),\
    \ show a couple of lines of code in the CURRENT_CODE before the place where NEW_CODE needs to be added.\nHere is an example\
    \ of how to add one line `i--;` in the for loop:\n------------------------example_2---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nlet i = 0;\ni++;\nfor (let j = 0; j < 100; j++) {\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nlet i = 0;\ni++;\nfor (let j = 0; j < 100;\
    \ j++) {\n    i--;\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------\n\nHere's an example\
    \ how to add code to the beginning of the file:\n------------------------example_3---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nconst app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nconst express = require('express');\n\
    const app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------\n\
    \nRule #3:\nDo not show the entire file under CURRENT_CODE and NEW_CODE but only the lines that need to be replaced. If\

    \ that is used in the rest of the file. Pay special attention to the indentation of the new code and make sure to include\
    \ all the required old and new code, without omitting anything.\nPay very close attention to parenthesis and make sure\
    \ that when CURRENT_CODE is replaced with NEW_CODE there are no extra parenthesis or any parenthesis missing.\n"
