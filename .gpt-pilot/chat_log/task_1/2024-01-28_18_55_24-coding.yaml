  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: 'You are working on a App called "AI_HyperLab" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks
    that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you''re working on, you''re given other specs for "AI_HyperLab"
    as well.


    Here is a high level description of "AI_HyperLab":

    ```

    "Hyper-Lab" is an innovative full-stack web application designed for managing AI projects using an autogen architecture.
    It combines a modern graphical user interface with advanced functionalities tailored for creating and managing specialized
    Autogen Agents.

    Enhanced Key Features and Functionalities:

    * Dynamic Creation of Specialized Autogen Agents: Up to eight agents are dynamically created for each project based on
    user-inputted prompts, including specific roles such as a ''boss'' and a ''critic''.

    * AI-Generated Agent Images: On user request, the software is capable of generating images for each agent, reflecting
    their functions and roles within the project. This visual representation adds a layer of intuitiveness and personalization
    to the user experience.

    * RAG Functionality: Each agent is equipped with Retrievable and Generative capabilities, enabling them to retain memory
    and learn incrementally, improving their performance over time.

    * Persistent and Concurrent Interactions: The platform ensures that interactions between agents are continuous and can
    occur simultaneously across multiple sessions.

    * Graphical User Interface (GUI): The GUI displays each agent in individual text boxes, complete with the agent''s name,
    specialization, and their AI-generated or user-uploaded image.

    * User Authentication and Real-Time Collaboration: Various access levels for enhanced security, along with features supporting
    real-time collaboration on AI projects.

    * Strict Adherence to Autogen Architecture: Exclusively utilizes Autogen architecture without integrating additional AI
    services or frameworks.

    * Responsive and Multilingual Design: The application is mobile-responsive and supports multiple languages, catering to
    a global audience.

    * Performance Metrics and Documentation: While specific performance metrics are yet to be established, the application
    is geared towards efficiency and user-friendliness. A detailed user manual will be provided in English.

    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

    ```


    - Node.js


    - Express


    - MongoDB


    - Mongoose


    - jsonwebtoken


    - Passport.js


    - bcryptjs


    - Socket.io


    - React


    - Redux


    - axios


    - Bootstrap


    - HTML


    - CSS3


    - cron


    - i18next


    - TensorFlow.js


    - sharp


    ```






    We''ve broken the development of this app down to these tasks:

    ```

    1. Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies including Node.js, Express, and
    Mongoose, and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.


    2. Set up the MongoDB connection using Mongoose and create the initial user schema and model, preparing for authentication
    and user data storage.


    3. Implement user authentication system using jsonwebtoken, Passport.js and bcryptjs, including routes for registration,
    login, and a middleware to protect certain routes.


    4. Develop the autogen agent creation functionality with up to eight agents per project and implement Agent model schemas
    and controllers.


    5. Integrate TensorFlow.js for Retrievable and Generative (RAG) capabilities of agents, enabling them to retain memory
    and learn over time.


    6. Develop the GUI for agent interaction using React and Redux, including text boxes for agent representation and the
    ability to upload or generate images for agents using the `sharp` library.


    7. Implement real-time collaboration features with Socket.io, allowing concurrent interactions and updates among different
    user sessions.


    8. Add multilingual support and a mobile-responsive design using i18next and Bootstrap, ensuring the application caters
    to a global audience.


    9. Finalize the application by setting up cron jobs for regular performance metric analysis and the preparation of a user
    manual in English.

    You are currently working on task #1 with the following description:

    ```

    Initialize the project and set up the server environment, install core dependencies including Node.js, Express, and Mongoose,
    and create a basic express server with a `/ping` endpoint.

    ```


    After all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `A reviewer can perform a GET
    request to `/ping` and receive a 200 OK response, confirming server setup.`


    Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands
    that need to be run to implement this task.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

    You do not need to make any automated tests work.


    DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative
    path to each file that needs to be written.


    Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it''s reserved.'

  content: "For task #1, you would need to write the initialization code for the Node.js server and set up the express framework\
    \ with a `/ping` endpoint. Below are the commands and code snippets necessary for completing this task:\n\n1. Initialize\
    \ a new Node.js project by running this command in the root directory:\n   ```sh\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n2. Install\
    \ the necessary dependencies:\n   ```sh\n   npm install express mongoose\n   ```\n\n3. Since the task does not specify,\
    \ you can choose any available port other than 5000. Let's assume that you choose port 3000 for running the server.\n\n\
    Now, you should create the main server file and express setup:\n\nFile: `/index.js`\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\n\
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\n// Basic endpoint\
    \ to respond to `/ping` request\napp.get('/ping', (req, res) => {\n  res.status(200).send('OK');\n});\n\n// Start the\
    \ server\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nAfter writing this\
    \ code, you can start the server by running the following command:\n```sh\nnode index.js\n```\n\nThis code sets up a basic\
    \ Express server that listens on the chosen port and responds to a GET request to the `/ping` endpoint with a status code\
    \ of 200 and the body text \"OK\".\n\nWith this, the programmatic goal for task #1 is completed - any reviewer performing\
    \ a GET request to `/ping` will receive a 200 OK response."
