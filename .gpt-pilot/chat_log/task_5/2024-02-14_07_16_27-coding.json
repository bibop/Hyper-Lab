    "content": "# AI_HyperLab\n\nAI_HyperLab is a revolutionary full-stack web application designed for the seamless management of AI projects. It embraces an autogen architecture to provide a collection of enhanced features for creating, training, and managing Autogen Agents.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Dynamic Specialized Autogen Agents**: Up to eight specialized agents can be dynamically spawned for each project, with distinct roles like 'boss' and 'critic'.\n- **AI-Generated Agent Imagery**: Custom images for each agent are generated based upon their roles to add a personal touch.\n- **RAG Functionality**: Agents have Retrievable and Generative capabilities for memory retention and incremental learning.\n- **Persistent & Concurrent Interactions**: Continuous and concurrent interactions between agents across sessions.\n- **GUI**: Intuitive graphical user interface showcasing agent details and images.\n- **Authentication & Real-Time Collaboration**: Secure multi-user support with real-time collaboration features.\n- **Autogen Architecture**: Strict utilization of Autogen architecture principles.\n- **Responsive Multilingual Support**: Compatibility with various device sizes and multiple languages.\n- **Performance Metrics & Documentation**: A forthcoming manual for optimal use and clarity on performance measures.\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose\n- Authentication: jsonwebtoken, Passport.js, bcryptjs\n- Real-time Communication: Socket.io\n- Frontend: React, Redux, axios, Bootstrap\n- Styling: HTML, CSS3\n- Scheduling: cron\n- Internationalization: i18next\n- AI Processing: TensorFlow.js\n- Image Processing: sharp\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system.\n\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```sh\n   npm install\n   ```\n3. Set up the environment variables in `.env` file as per the example in `.env.example`\n4. Start the application:\n   ```sh\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter starting the server, navigate to the provided local server URL, usually `http://localhost:PORT` where `PORT` is defined in your `.env` file.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information on using AI_HyperLab, refer to the in-depth user manual (to be provided).\n\n## Autogen Resources\n\nRefer to these articles and blog posts for more details on Autogen architecture and implementation:\n\n- [Autogen Architecture Overview](https://autogen.microsoft.com/blog/overview)\n- [Agent AutoBuild Example](https://autogen.microsoft.com/blog/agent-autobuild)\n- [More Articles on Autogen](https://autogen.microsoft.com/blog/articles)\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the ISC License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nSpecial thanks to the creators and contributors towards the development and maintenance of the Autogen framework and the associated technologies listed.\n"
